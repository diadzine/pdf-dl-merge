pdf-dl-merge
============

At the beginning, restaurants for lunch offer their weekly menu as PDF file.
I wanted an easier way to read menus as a single PDF file.

So, I wrote this snippet to download several PDF files, merge all in one and open the result PDF file in a PDF viewer.


Requirements
------------

This script needs PyPDF2 to merge PDF files all in one:
`pip install PyPDF2`


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

Just clone this repository.
Edit the `settings.py` file and changes the values to your needs.


Run
---

To execute the script, run:
`python pdf-dl-merge.py`
